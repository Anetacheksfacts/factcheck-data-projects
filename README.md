# Fact-checking & data projects

I am Aneta, a Czech professional living in Berlin since 2019, currently transitioning from procurement to fact-checking and data analysis.  
I am preparing to study as a Gasthörerin at TU Berlin in SoSe 2026 and to start a BA at FU or HU in WiSe 2026/27.

This repository collects my practice projects that combine:
- political and media fact-checking,
- work with official statistics,
- simple data analysis and visualisation (spreadsheets, Datawrapper).

## Projects

### 1. Crime among Ukrainians in the Czech Republic – what the data really show

See folder `okamura-ukrainians-crime/` for:
- description of the claim and context,
- data sources and method,
- links to my Datawrapper charts.
