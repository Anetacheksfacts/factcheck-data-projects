# Crime among Ukrainians in the Czech Republic – fact-check & data visualisation

## 1. Claim

Czech politician Tomio Okamura stated that, according to the Ministry of the Interior, crime among Ukrainians in the Czech Republic increased by 45% in the last year.

The number (around +45%) is factually correct, but without context it creates an alarmist impression that is not supported by the data.

## 2. Data & sources

- Annual report of the Czech prosecution service (2023) – number of prosecuted persons by nationality.
- Population data for Ukrainians and Czech citizens in 2021 and 2023.
- My own calculations of crime rates per 1,000 inhabitants.

## 3. Method

In this project, I:

1. Extracted the number of prosecuted Ukrainians and Czechs in 2021 and 2023.  
2. Collected the estimated population of Ukrainians and Czechs in those years.  
3. Calculated crime rates per 1,000 inhabitants for both groups.  
4. Compared:
   - the share of foreigners among all prosecuted persons, and  
   - the crime rate of Ukrainians vs. Czechs over time.  
5. Created two charts in Datawrapper to make the differences visible.

## 4. Findings

- Foreigners (including Ukrainians) make up only a small fraction of all prosecuted persons in the Czech Republic.  
- The absolute number of prosecuted Ukrainians increased mainly because the number of Ukrainians living in the country rose sharply due to the war.  
- When adjusted for population, Ukrainians still have a lower crime rate than Czech citizens in both years.  

This means the 45% figure, presented without context, can easily mislead the public into overestimating the “criminality” of Ukrainians.
