# Fact-checking & data projects

I am Aneta, a Czech living in Berlin since 2019.
This repository collects my practice projects that combine:
- political and media fact-checking,
- work with official statistics,
- simple data analysis and visualisation (spreadsheets, Datawrapper).

These are independent practice projects created to develop my skills in fact-checking and data analysis. They are not affiliated with or produced for any organisation.
The structure of the fact-checks is inspired by common standards in the fact-checking community (e.g. Demagog.cz, Full Fact), but all texts and analyses here are my own.
